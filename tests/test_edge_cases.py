Edge Case Tests

Tests for edge cases and error handling across all components.
Following TDD approach: tests written FIRST, verified to FAIL, then implementation.

Test Coverage:
- T079-T086: User Story 2 - BODMAS precedence verification
- T097-T111: User Story 4 - Invalid input handling
- Negative operand combinations
- Chained operations
- All error types with specific messages
