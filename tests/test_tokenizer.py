Tokenizer Component Tests

Tests for the Tokenizer class that converts string input into tokens.
Following TDD approach: tests written FIRST, verified to FAIL, then implementation.

Test Coverage:
- T006: Basic operators (+, -, *, /)
- T007: Positive integers, whitespace handling
- T008: Unary minus detection (start, after operators)
- T009: Invalid characters raise errors
- T010: Empty/whitespace-only input raises errors
